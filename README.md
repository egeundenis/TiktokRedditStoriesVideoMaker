This project allows you to automatically generate TikTok-ready videos from a text file. It takes text input, converts it to speech, synchronizes it with a background video, transcribes the audio into subtitles, and (optionally) mixes background music. The result is a vertical 1080x1920 video optimized for TikTok.
